# ami
An advanved math interpreter written in C++
supports math constants and user defined identifiers

## expressions
regular maths expressions such as multiplication, addition, substraction,
division, power and the module operator.
identifiers can be builtin such as: pi, tau, eu(constant e), inf, nan
or user defined by `my_iden = 5;`.
numbers can be negative/positive decimals/integers, can also be written as
`1'000'000` and `1e5` for more readablity.
this project is still not yet stable, any issue or pr is appreciated
